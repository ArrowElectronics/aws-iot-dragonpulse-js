# Overview

The general elements, IAM and IoT policies, API, and dashboard of the
DragonPulse example should have been configured.

One of the final steps is to create a thing and an associated principal
(certificate) and attach the principal to the DragonPulse IoT policy.
The things.js script in the admin module will perform these actions.

This documentation assumes that the prerequisites for the admin module have
been satisfied earlier through the configuration of the
[Foundation](./foundation.html).

# Create

The DragonPulse client uses the machine identifier as the thingId.
The following command will store the machine identifier in the THING_ID
environment variable and then create the thing

```sh
$ cd admin
$ export THING_ID=$(cat /etc/machine-id)
$ node lib/things.js create ${THING_ID}
```

The certificate of the thing with identifier of ${THING_ID} will be stored
in the location specified in the [General Configuration](./general_conf.html).
The default location is

```sh
$ cd ~/arrow/registry/${THING_ID}
```

## DragonPulse Client Application

The DragonPulse client application requires the generated certificates to
establish a secure connection to the MQTT server.  The certificate of the
thing with identifier of ${THING_ID} will be stored in the location specified
in the [General Configuration](./general_conf.html).  The instructions below
assume the use of the default location.  Copy the private key and public
certificate to the certs directory

```sh
$ cd DragonBoard/certs
$ cp ~/arrow/registry/${THING_ID}/aws.{key,crt} .
```

# Delete

The things.js script will also delete a thing.  This involves detaching the
DragonPulse IoT policy, deactivating associated certificate, deleting the
certificate, and, finally, deleting the thing

```sh
$ cd admin
$ node lib/things.js delete $(cat /etc/machine-id)
```
